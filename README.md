# NBA Player Tweeter

Did you know that last year, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had almost the same amount of points, rebounds and assists as superstar Steph Curry? <a href="http://twitter.com/c_swish_stats/" target="_blank">@c_swish_stats on Twitter</a> shows more comparisons like this every day!  Give it a follow!

### Under the hood

This bot works together with my website <a href="http://www.cswishstats.com" target="_blank">cswishstats.com</a> to show potentially interesting comparisons to Twitter users. You can review tons of auto-generated comparisons on the website, and mark the ones worth tweeting. These comparisons are generated by querying player statistics from the current NBA season that I store in MongoDB. Stats are updated nightly thanks to <a href="https://www.balldontlie.io" target="_blank">Ball Dont Lie API</a>.

Once you indicate that a comparison is interesting on <a href="http://www.cswishstats.com" target="_blank">cswishstats.com</a>, that pair is stored in MongoDB and periodically tweeted out on @c_swish_stats (give it a follow!)

If no one uses the website (likely), no need to worry! The twitter bot, <a href="http://twitter.com/c_swish_stats/" target="_blank">@c_swish_stats</a>, will continue to generate and tweet comparisons all on its own.

Twitter bot is powered by AWS Lambda, deployed with the serverless framework.
Website is hosted an on an Ubuntu Server on AWS running nginx.
